## Introduction

[AI Endpoints](https://endpoints.ai.cloud.ovh.net/) is a serverless platform provided by OVHcloud that offers easy access to a selection of world-renowned, pre-trained AI models. The platform is designed to be simple, secure, and intuitive, making it an ideal solution for developers who want to enhance their applications with AI capabilities without extensive AI expertise or concerns about data privacy.

## Objective

This page provides the technical features, capabilities and limitations of [AI Endpoints](https://endpoints.ai.cloud.ovh.net/).

## Features

### Available features

| Feature                                    | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Large Selection of Models                        | AI Endpoints offers a diverse range of pre-trained AI models, covering categories such as Assistant (LLMs, Code Assistants), Audio Analysis, Embeddings, Natural Language Processing, Translation, Image Generation, and Computer Vision. For a full list of models, please visit the [AI Endpoints Catalog Page](https://endpoints.ai.cloud.ovh.net/catalog).                                                                          |
| Model Metrics | Users can access various metrics in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), such as the number of calls made per model, input and output tokens for large language models (LLMs), and other usage data. These insights can help you manage costs and gain a better understanding of how your applications are using AI capabilities.                                                                                              |
| Data Privacy and Sovereignty | OVHcloud prioritizes data privacy and sovereignty, ensuring that AI models accessed via AI Endpoints are fully compliant with strict European regulations. Our infrastructure, located in Gravelines, France, adheres to European data protection regulations. Data is not stored or shared during or after model use, providing users with peace of mind that their data is secure and protected.                                                                          |
| Access with Personalized Tokens | To ensure secure and authenticated access to model APIs, users need to provide a token for each request. Access tokens can easily be created through the [AI Endpoints](https://endpoints.ai.cloud.ovh.net) page, providing the flexibility to manage multiple tokens for various projects or teams. Additionally, each token comes with adjustable validity periods, allowing users to tailor their access to specific needs. 

### Planned features

| Planned Feature                                    | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSON Mode                        | AI Endpoints plans to support JSON mode in the future, which will allow you to send and receive data in a format that's easy to understand and integrate into your applications. This feature will make it simple to work with AI models and ensure that your data is correctly formatted for the models to process.                                                                          |
| Function Calling | AI Endpoints also plans to support function calling in the future, which will allow you to invoke specific functions within a model, making it easier to use only the capabilities you need. |
| Easy billing | Soon, you will be able to monitor your estimated consumption and resource usage via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), in the `AI Endpoints`{.action} section of the `AI & Machine Learning` category, in the left-hand vertical menu. This will give you an idea of your potential charges, once the billing system is enabled (future General Availability (GA) phase).

## Capabilities

### Compatibility with OpenAI API

AI Endpoints is designed to be compatible with the OpenAI API, making it easy to integrate with existing applications and workflows. This compatibility means that you can take advantage of AI capabilities without having to make major changes to your existing technology stack, allowing you to get up and running quickly and easily.

### Flexibile Usage

AI Endpoints' APIs are language-agnostic. It enables developers to use any programming language or technology of their choice when working with our APIs, providing them with the freedom to build and integrate AI capabilities according to their requirements and preferences.

## Limitations for the beta phase

### No Token Limit

As of now, the AI Endpoints platform does not impose a token limit for API requests.

In the future, we plan to introduce a token limit feature. This feature will allow you to set a limit on the number of tokens used for each API request, providing better control and management over token consumption.
