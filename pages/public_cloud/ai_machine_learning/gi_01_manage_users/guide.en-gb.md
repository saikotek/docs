## Objective

The **users** of the **OVHcloud AI Solutions** are simply the users of your [Public Cloud project](/links/public-cloud/public-cloud), which can be created and managed in the [OVHcloud Control Panel (UI)](/links/manager).

The objective of this guide is to demonstrate how to create, configure, and delete AI users and their roles.

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](/links/public-cloud/public-cloud) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Creating and Editing AI users

To grant access to **OVHcloud AI Solutions** to the users of your Public Cloud Project, you can assign them either the **AI Training Operator** or **AI Training Reader** role.

- The **AI Training Operator** role provides complete access to **AI Notebooks, AI Training, and AI Deploy** solutions. With this role, users can launch, stop, and delete AI Solutions, as well as authenticate to existing AI Notebooks, Jobs, and Apps, and the [ovhai CLI](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/cli_10_howto_install_cli) using their credentials.

- If you don't need to launch, stop, or delete **AI Solutions**, but are only interested in access existing already deployed ones, the **AI Training Reader** role is sufficient. This role allows users to access existing AI Solutions, but not to launch, stop, or delete them.

In addition to the AI Training role, we strongly recommend adding the **ObjectStore Operator** role to your AI users. This role provides read/write access to the **OVHcloud Object Storage**, which is a persistent storage solution to store your [data](/pages/public_cloud/ai_machine_learning/gi_02_concepts_data) that is incorporated into our AI Solutions. This way, you can access your data within the **AI Solutions**.

To apply these roles, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager), and navigate to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section, in the horizontal menu at the top of the website. Select the Public Cloud project you want to use. Then, click on the `Project Management`{.action} category in the left-hand vertical menu to access the `Users & Roles`{.action} section.

On this page, you can either **create a new user** for your Public Cloud project or **edit the roles of an existing user**.

**1\. Create a new user**

Click on `+ Add user`{.action}, specify a name as the user's description, and **assign the required roles** to use the AI Solutions with the Object Storage (**AI Training Operator** or **AI Training Reader**, depending on the level of access you want to grant, and the **ObjectStore Operator**).

This will generate a password that will allow you to authenticate to your AI Notebooks, Jobs and Apps, as well as via the `ovhai` CLI.

If you ever lose this password, you can regenerate it at any time by clicking the `...`{.action} button next to your user, and then on `Generate a password`{.action}.

**2\. Edit an existing user roles**

To edit an existing user, simply click the `...`{.action} button next to the user, and select `Edit roles` to modify its existing roles.

> [!primary]
>
> - Access to **AI Solutions** can be revoked anytime by deleting the user or removing its **AI Training Operator / Reader** role.
> - To be able to use the OVHcloud Object Storage, make sure that the user has the **Objectstore Operator** role.
